# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Researched answer: so basically git a version control system used worldwide(?) to track all the various versions of the many files used by individuals.
  Github is a web page that hosts thousands of repositories in the cloud using thier services.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: the js operators that will return a Boolean values are Relational, Logical and Equality operators as they will give either a True or False output.

  Researched answer: Booleans values are used primaraly for data evaluations. As the name implies Equality operators give Boolean values as equal to being true or false in a losse or strict way. Relational operators show the relation between two values and Logical operators join statments. They use "and", "or" and "not", similar to conjuctions in the english language. They state the the equations are either true, half true or not true at all.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  of said Index.

  Researched answer: Index is an expression that contains the position of an an element. The output is the value expressed
  in a number.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: This is a process that is executed repeatedly a number of times or until you get a specific result.

  Researched answer: An action that is basically run over and over until you get the condtion that you were looking for or it can be a process just runnining continously.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: I think a few good techniques of pair programming are identifying what is the task and then come up with a plan of action by talking through what you want to do. Maybe do some research on the plan. One person drives while the other "directs traffic". Each person should be observant of whats going on to be able to catch things each may have missed or even provide insight or shortcuts that one or the other may not know. They should be able to switch roles from time to time.

  Researched answer: A practice in software programming/developement where two programmers work together to complete a particlar project. It helps in having fewer mistakes or errors on the task. With two persons, it can possibly increase the knowledege set between both persons.
